# HomeWebServer
 Small server for the home LAN.

Currently containing the LegacyPWM and an appointment reminder.
As more ideas pop into my head, this server will grow.
(Planned so far: Video/Photo viewer, new PWM)

Task distribution with Celery and Rabbitmq as broker.
(While I'm aware that it is a bit overkill for a project this small, I decided to set it up now, to make upscaling easier down the road.)
